- ❌ Spending too much time on UI polish
- ❌ Over-engineering with unnecessary features
- ❌ No working demo (just slides)
- ❌ Not using demo data effectively
- ❌ Ignoring one of the APIs

**Success Strategies:**
- ✅ Pick one problem, solve it well
- ✅ Use AI to scaffold quickly, then customize
- ✅ Test with real Geotab demo data
- ✅ Have a backup plan if live demo fails
- ✅ Show your personality and passion

## 🔌 MCP Power-Ups: Beyond Official MCP

**Build capabilities the official Geotab MCP won't have.** The official MCP endpoint will have API + Ace access, but runs in the cloud. Your custom MCP runs locally with unique advantages.

### Current State

| MCP Option | What It Has | What It Lacks |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Official (coming)** | API + Ace, read/write, cloud-hosted | Local processing, custom tools/skills |
| **Felipe's demo** | Ace queries, DuckDB caching | Direct API calls (you can add!) |
| **Your hackathon project** | Whatever you build! | Nothing - sky's the limit |

### Unique Capabilities to Build

| Capability | Why Build It | Hackathon Project |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Direct API + Ace** | Felipe's demo is Ace-only | Add direct API calls for real-time data |
| **DuckDB Local Caching** | Official = cloud-only | Cache datasets locally, run SQL offline |
| **Custom Skills/Tools** | Build specialized methods | Fuel theft detection, parking optimization, carbon tracking |
| **MCP Composability** | Combine multiple MCP servers | Geotab + Google Maps + Slack working together |
| **Custom Frameworks** | Your analysis patterns | Safety scoring algorithms, route optimization |
| **Offline Mode** | Query cached data without internet | Field workers with spotty connectivity |

### MCP Composability

**Multiple MCP servers can work together** in the same conversation:

```
You: "Find my 5 vehicles with most idle time last week,
      then find the nearest charging stations to their usual locations,
      and post a summary to Slack."

Claude uses:
  → Geotab MCP: Query idle time data
  → Google Maps MCP: Find charging stations
  → Slack MCP: Post the summary
```

**Hackathon idea:** Build a Geotab MCP that's designed to work alongside other MCPs. Expose clean tools that compose well.

### Example: Add Direct API to Felipe's Demo

```
"Fork geotab-ace-mcp-demo and add direct API tools alongside Ace:
- geotab_get_vehicle_location(vehicle_id) → real-time position (<1s)
- geotab_get_trips(vehicle_id, date) → trip list
- geotab_create_zone(name, lat, lon, radius) → write operation

Keep Ace for complex questions, use direct API for real-time + writes."
```

### Example: Multi-MCP Workflow

```
"Build a fleet operations assistant that combines:
1. Geotab MCP for fleet data
2. Weather API MCP for conditions
3. Calendar MCP for scheduling

Enable queries like: 'Which vehicles are near areas with
severe weather warnings? Reschedule their deliveries.'"
```

### Why This Matters

- Official MCP: Great for standard queries, but one-size-fits-all
- Your MCP: Local processing, custom tools, works with other MCPs
- Composability: The whole is greater than the sum of parts

## 🧠 Build Reusable Skills

**Create AI skills others can use.** Skills are packaged knowledge that any AI assistant can leverage. Building a skill is a great hackathon project because it's reusable and demonstrates deep understanding.

### What is a Skill?

A skill is a structured document (SKILL.md) that teaches AI assistants how to accomplish specific tasks. See [skills/](../skills/) for examples.

### High-Value Skills to Build

| Skill | Why It's Needed | Difficulty |
|-------|-----------------|------------|
| **geotab-trip-analysis** | Most common use case, no skill exists yet | ⭐⭐ |
| **geotab-safety-scoring** | Critical for fleet safety, complex calculations | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **geotab-fuel-theft-detection** | Real money savings, pattern detection | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **geotab-parking-optimization** | Find best spots from historical data | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **geotab-predictive-maintenance** | High value, requires ML patterns | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **geotab-carbon-tracking** | Growing demand, ESG reporting | ⭐⭐ |
| **geotab-driver-coaching** | Combines safety + communication | ⭐⭐⭐ |

### Specialized Skill Ideas

**Fuel Theft Detection:**
```
"Create a skill that detects fuel theft by analyzing:
- Sudden fuel level drops without corresponding distance
- Fuel transactions that don't match vehicle location
- Unusual refueling patterns (time, location, amount)
- Comparison against expected consumption rates"
```

**Parking Spot Optimization:**
```
"Create a skill that finds optimal parking from historical data:
- Analyze where vehicles commonly stop and for how long
- Identify patterns by time of day, day of week
- Score locations by availability, safety, proximity to destinations
- Recommend best parking spots for delivery routes"
```

### Skill Building Prompt

```
"Create a SKILL.md file for [skill name] that teaches AI assistants how to:
- [specific capability 1]
- [specific capability 2]

Include code patterns, common mistakes to avoid, and example use cases.
Follow the format in skills/geotab/SKILL.md"
```

### Why Judges Love Skill Projects

- **Reusable:** Your work helps everyone, not just your project
- **Deep expertise:** Shows you truly understand the domain
- **Documentation:** Proves you can communicate technical concepts
- **Community impact:** Skills become part of the ecosystem

## 🚀 Getting Unstuck

**"I don't know where to start"**
→ Use this prompt: "I want to build [idea name]. Help me create a project plan with steps, technologies to use, and first 3 API calls to make."

**"My AI-generated code isn't working"**
→ Share the error with AI: "I got this error: [paste error]. Here's my code: [paste code]. How do I fix it?"

**"I'm not sure what tech stack to use"**
→ Ask AI: "What's the best tech stack for building [your idea] that works with Geotab API? Consider that I know [your languages]."

**"I need inspiration"**
→ Browse the Geotab SDK showcase: https://geotab.github.io/sdk/

**"I want to see examples"**
→ Check the code repository shared during the tutorial
